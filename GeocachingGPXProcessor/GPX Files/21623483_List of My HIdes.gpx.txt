So what we have now is a well-commoed bison tube placed somewhere in this interesting spot.&lt;br /&gt;
Every time I'm there I think "someone should hide one here.".  Well, now that someone is me.&lt;br /&gt;
Should be a fairly quick C&amp;amp;D for most of y'all. Although I suspect a few will not get the benefit from the correct viewing angle for some protracted period of time.&lt;br /&gt;
If the weather's nice you should pick a bench and set a spell.&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy.

Did not search for this one properly and we left,   Called a paf and went back.   We searched the right area but omitted 1 small spot.   Guess where the cache was.  Signed and returned.

Note to finders coming after: this container lid cracked slightly as I was attempting to open it... Just a light and careful touch with it, and I think it will continue to function well.

This was a nice, well-executed hide. We had just arrived in the area, with a one-night stay booked at the hotel across PA-100.  I stopped for gas, as well as some drinks/snacks to take over to the hotel, but it seemed to make sense to pop the geo-app up to see if anything was nearby after pumping the gas. Sure enough, 160 feet or so... sweet!

So after a bit of a search, I was reading some logs and thinking I did not want to do the obvious thing near GZ... Sure enough, as I kind of expanding my thinking and searching, I spotted the nice container setup here. Again, well done!

I waited until my wife and daughter were done inside the store before we all made the find together and signed the log.

I asked if the Zook House was archived could I please resurrect Lloyd via this cache.
I should have updated the coordinates before asking; my bad.
I see Zook House is disabled so this should be good (fingers crossed):
I'm going to disable "Find More and Log it in"

Out on a caching adventure today with Tagging Along.  
Tagging along made quick work of this one we used parking coordinates given which seems best so nice little area someone wanted to go look for a new sofa but I talked her out of it So I got more than a cash  
  
I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I  
The finders, are out and Caching  
To locate what hiders are stashing;  
They disturbed many crickets  
While rooting through thickets  
The search keeps them constantly dashing.  
I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I  
May the Finds be ever in your Favor...  
I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I  
May you always find what you are looking for, and may what you are looking for be what you find... However enjoy the fun, and surprises.  
Thank you ServerSide6

Could have made this a 'bridges' cache.  The remnants of a bridge abutments are clearly visible on both sides of the trail.  Maybe it was the old Swedesford Road bridge or Bacton Hill Road bridge or both.</groundspeak:text>

The stop didn't end up being quite that quick -- I parked us a little far from the cache so we did a fair amount of searching. Finally spotted something that looked suspicious and sure enough it was the cache. A very nicely done one, thanks for hiding it, favorite point given!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Sunday caching with good friend skibumz.   Hibernia Park was our main obective but we picked up many others on the way to and from the Park.  A fairly cold day but some early sun made it a bit more bearable.  Found some awesome containers, especially on the Naming the Bridge series.  

A fast find. Thanks ServerSide6 for placing and maintaining this cache.

Mugglage factor could be high so try to be discrete. You never know who might spot you acting strangely from their window. Same container as #1 but a very different hide. Enjoy the hunt.

&lt;b&gt;Coordinates are for picture, be sure to park in the road a safe distance from the intersection in the direction of traffic.&lt;/b&gt; Really cool sight! If you haven't been by here before then you really must, you can thank me later. If you've been there, done that already then you still get a smiley. &lt;b&gt;See below for credit instructions&lt;/b&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You must take a unique picture of the Inuksuk (see below) without any of the other items of interest in the background to get credit for this one. Spoiler pictures will get your log deleted; Sorry.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You need not include yourself in the picture if that makes you at all uncomfortable!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always thought this spot deserves a geocache but the signage and apparent lack of safe, legal, etc. parking spots has always left me abandoning the idea. But when I was gifted by Geocaching.com the opportunity to place a virtual cache this spot was the first to pop in to mind. So I decided to head out, get the coordinates and at the same time see if I could find someone to talk to and inquire about the property and who owns it. I was fortunate enough to talk to a senior family member and had a great conversation about the property and its history. The owners ask that you park a safe distance from the corner and on the side of the road that corresponds to your direction of travel and don't go onto the grass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several interesting facts about the place but I don't want ruin the surprise. I'll send you more info upon request after you make the find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I will tell you now, however, is that you will see an &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuksuk"&gt;Inuksuk.&lt;/a&gt; The dad's side of the family has proud Canadian lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Virtual Reward - 2017/2018&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Virtual Cache is part of a limited release of Virtuals created between August 24, 2017 and August 24, 2018. Only 4,000 cache owners were given the opportunity to hide a Virtual Cache. Learn more about Virtual Rewards on the &lt;a href="https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2017/08/virtual-rewards/"&gt;Geocaching Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out with Hornbaker for a day of caching. We pulled up and had this one much quicker than some of this CO’s caches.  It may also help that I found another one like this already.  I am fairly certain we would have found it either way.  I am sure I gave the other one I spoke of in my log a fav, so I will give this a fav as well.  TFTC. </groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Met urpickle halfway today at Thorndale and we cached though Thorndale, Downingtown, and Uwchlan Township! A good amount of driving, but a very successful day, with around 50 finds and 1 DNF. Beautiful 7 degree day as well with a good mix of park and grabs and hiking. Caching is always better with good friends.

Quick find, nicely done! Had a hard time reconstructing the cache but it is in great shape. I think I am almost done finding all of your active caches. thanks!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Zippy holds the log. Poke him a bit and you might get where his name comes from. TOT is there to help extract as well as re-roll the log before returning it to Zippy. Please make sure Zippy and TOT remain in the same abode.

&lt;p&gt;You do not need to stand on the bridge itself to make the grab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need to leave the sidewalk to make the grab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you make the find you should, hopefully, understand the names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you park near the posted parking coordinates you can stroll the entire distance to GZ on the sidewalk. Other options will likely involve a short climb up a fairly steep grassy bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You DO NOT need to do anything or go anywhere at all dangerous to make this grab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do a good job replacing!&lt;/p&gt;
BYOP and keep a sharp eye out for muggles from all directions and elevations.&lt;/div&gt;
